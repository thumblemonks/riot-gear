# @markup markdown

# 0.0.14

* Allow `denies_json` to deny a string in the reponse json

# 0.0.13

* Allow `asserts_status` to inspect named responses [jaknowlden]

# 0.0.12

* Allow OPTIONS HTTP calls [rquinlivan]

# 0.0.10

* Defines a new setup block called `once`. Useful for running a single block before assertions, but only inside the context it was defined in [jaknowlden]

```ruby
context ThingsMaker do
  once do
    topic.post "/things/make", :query => { :name => "Jacques" }
  end

  format :json
  get "/things/1"

  asserts_json("name").equals("Jacques")

  context "makes no more things" do
    get "/things/2"
    asserts_status(404) # because the post didn't run again ... see ... yeah
  end
end
```

# 0.0.9

* get, post, put, delete can have responses saved for use in other requests within the same (or nested) context [jaknowlden]

```ruby
context GoNuts do
  post(:the_new_nut) do
    { :path => "/make/some", :body => "..." }
  end

  get do
    { :path => "/get/some/#{response(:the_new_nut)["id"]}" }
  end
end
```

The last get, post, put, or delete in the context will still be the one used for assertions.

* get, post, put, delete can take a block that expects a settings hash to be returned (with a path) [jaknowlden]

```ruby
context GoNuts do
  post do
    { :path => "/make/some", :body => "..." }
  end

  get do
    { :path => "/get/some", :query => { ... } }
  end
end
```

* tons of documentation [jaknowlden]
